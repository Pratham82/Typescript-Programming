// TypeScript introduced a new data type called Tuple.Tuple can contain two values of different data types.

var employee: [number, string] = [1, "Steve"];

// A tuple type variable can include multiple data types as shown below

var user: [number, string, boolean, number, string];
user = [12, "User1", true, 20, "Admin"];

//* Nested tuple
